# Twitch-Clips-to-Shorts

WIP Tool to automatically download and edit Twitch clips to short-form content.
Currently works through hard-coded search for a streamer ("broadcaster") in a specified date range. Script downloads the specified number of Twitch clips (top clips from specified date range), crops the camera (found through specified coordinate values), and arranges the camera on top of gameplay, which is cropped to fit proper aspect ratio.

TODO:
Change hard-coded streamer, date, # of clips, and camera coordinates to user-inputted
